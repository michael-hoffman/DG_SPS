## Introduction

Stellar population synthesis models are valuable tools for determining how
stellar evolution leads to the galaxy characteristics we observe in nature.  In
light of the recent gravitational wave discovery by LIGO, it is important to
properly model the frequency and behavior of binary stars.  By determining the
best places to look for massive binary progenitors (and thus potential LIGO
event binary black holes), scientists can better predict the frequency of future
gravitational wave detections.  The goal of this project is to compare stellar
population synthesis models with and without binary star evolution and
investigate how these compare with observed data for dwarf galaxies in the
RESOLVE survey.  We will determine the likelihood of models from BPASS by
comparing broadband magnitudes to those from RESOLVE using a Bayesian approach,
resulting in estimates of various parameters (age, metallicity, binary fraction, mass fraction ) after marginalization. We will also provide galaxy mass estimates
using a method mirroring the one used in the RESOLVE survey. Through careful
analysis of our results, we hope to determine how significant a role binary
stars play in the evolution of dwarf galaxies, thereby telling us where to point
(or not to point) our gravitational wave detectors in the future!
